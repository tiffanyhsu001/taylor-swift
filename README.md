# Taylor Swift Sentiment Analysis

### Objective
The main goal for this analysis was to do sentiment analysis on Taylor Swift's albums and individual songs to figure out whether certain albums had more positivity or negativity than other ones.

### Methodology
For this sentiment analysis, I performed BING Analysis, AFINN Analysis, and NRC Analysis. Bing analysis assigns each individual word as negative, positive, or neutral from a lexicon. Similarly, AFINN assigns each word a numerical value from -5 to 5, with -5 being an extremely negative word (ie death). NRC groups words into their respective groups (ie surprise, joy, sadness, etc).

### Conclusion
Taylor Swift's album 'Red' had the most positive sentiment, meaning she used more positive words in her music. When taking a closer look within 'Red,' it is apparent that all her songs did not score below 0 in AFINN analysis except for 'I Knew You Were Trouble' and 'We are Never Getting Back Together.' Overall, the positivity of the rest of her songs caused her overall album 'Red' to be the most positive, with songs 'Lucky One' and 'Begin Again' driving the scores up.
